== Which wave models are supported? Is model xxxx supported? ==
May 2013: just S8500 (Wave I) and S8530 (Wave II). 
Others wave models have very different hardware and it is almost a new whole port.   

== Are calls / data connection working? ==
No at the moment (may 2013). More Badadroid RIL implementation is necessary, and it is not a simple task.

There is another similar way, using adb shell
Run from command line (windows, linux) "adb logcat -b system -b radio -b events -b main  > logcat.log", and you will have logcat.log file in your local file system in your computer.

Tips to run "adb":
  * you have to install android SDK, which includes adb utility.
  * you have to enabe in your wave checkbox at Settings > Developer options > Android debugging
  * of course, you have to have your wave plugged to your PC , if not, you receive message "error: device not found"

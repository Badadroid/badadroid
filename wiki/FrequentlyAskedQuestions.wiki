This page should contain answer for most questions asked by non developers, subjects too many times asked in XDA thread.

== Which wave models are supported? Is model xxxx supported? ==
May 2013: just S8500 (Wave I) and S8530 (Wave II). 
Others wave models have very different hardware and it is almost a new whole port.   

== Are voice calls / data (GPRS, 3G...) connection   working? Why not?==
No at the moment (may 2013). More Badadroid RIL implementation is necessary, and it is not a simple task. There are also issues related with mic and PCM packets. 

== How do I install badadroid? ==
Look for "FIRST INSTALLATION" in http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1851818

== How do I report a bug / take logs / save logcat ? ==
Look for "BUG REPORTS" in http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1851818

There is another similar way, using adb shell
Run from command line (windows, linux) "adb logcat -b system -b radio -b events -b main  > logcat.log", and you will have logcat.log file in your local file system in your computer.

Tips to run "adb":
  * you have to install android SDK, which includes adb utility.
  * you have to enabe in your wave checkbox at Settings > Developer options > Android debugging
  * of course, you have to have your wave plugged to your PC , if not, you receive message "error: device not found"

== How do I install Google Play? ==
Start CWM Recovery and install http://goo.im/gapps/gapps-jb-20121011-signed.zip 
(It has to be this version for CyanogenMod 10.1, check "Use this table to figure out which package you need!" table in http://goo.im/gapps)

== Why message "Unfortunately, Android keyboard (AOSP) has stopped" ? ==
Wrong gapss version.

== Badadroid is stuck in animation with rotating circle where Cyanogenmod is written in ==
It happens if you don't comply with installation requirements. Enter Bada Settings->General->Memory and make sure you have at least:
  * 370MB of free "System" memory
  * 150MB of free "User" memory
  * 400MB of free "Applications" memory
Solution: make a clean installation of bada: full flash

== Badadroid is going to work with xxx custom Bada firmware ? ==
Yes, you just have to flash the right bootfiles and FOTA, and comply with Bada Badadroid requirements (see above)

== How do I make badadroid use external SD as main storage / install apps in external SD Card? ==
Install swap_SD.zip (search for it in threads, for example http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1851818&page=125)

== How do I change phone ID ?
Some apps like Whatsapp do not work if model is GT-S8500 or GT-S8530; look for GTI9000.zip in threads

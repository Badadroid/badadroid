For uploading binaries please use one of following
- https://code.google.com/p/badadroid/downloads/entry
- attach them to the forum posts on XDA
- use some free FTP
- use some file hosting service

It's really annyoing to download binary files from SOURCECODE repository with slow internet speed.

I've moved all binaries to code.google download repository.

Thank you
